/**
 * Utilities to create and use generators which can be manipulated in various ways.
 *
 * Most methods come both as instance (prototype) methods and as static methods. They
 * provide equivalent functionality, but the static methods allow use on `Iterator` and
 * `Iterable` objects without first converting to a generator.
 *
 * The [[EnhancedGenerator.enhance]] method will add additional instance methods to
 * an ordinary generator's prototype (a new prototype, **not** modifying any global prototype!).
 * It can also be used to convert `Iterator` and `Iterable` objects to [[EnhancedGenerator]].
 *
 * For methods which return a EnhancedGenerator, care is take to propagate any `Generator.throw`
 * and `Generator.return` calls to any supplied generators, so they can properly terminate.
 *
 * The exception is [[EnhancedGenerator.flat]] (and by extension, [[EnhancedGenerator.flatMap]]), which cannot know what nested generators
 * they might encounter in the future. Any generators encountered so far will be terminated, however.
 *
 * @typeParam T the type of values returned in the iteration result.
 * @typeParam TReturn the type of values returned in the iteration result when the generator terminates
 * @typeParam TNext the type of value which can be passed to `.next(val)`.
